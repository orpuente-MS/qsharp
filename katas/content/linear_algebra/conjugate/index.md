**Input:** None.

**Goal:** Return the conjugate of the following matrix:

$$\begin{bmatrix} 1 + 5i & 2 \\\ 3 - 6i & 4i \end{bmatrix}$$

> In this and the next few tasks, the matrices are represented as Q# `Complex[][]` type, two-dimensional arrays of complex numbers. If you need a refresher on how to work with this data type, check out Complex Arithmetic kata.
