**Input:** None.

**Goal:** Return the normalized vector $V$, defined as $\frac{V}{||V||}$, where 

$$V = \begin{bmatrix} -6 \\\ 8i \end{bmatrix}$$

> Vectors are $n \times 1$ matrices, so in this exercise the result is represented as a two-dimensional array of complex numbers, with two rows each containing exactly one element. Vectors are commonly represented as one-dimensional arrays.
